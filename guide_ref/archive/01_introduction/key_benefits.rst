<<Needs rewording. We want to rephrase to highlight our good things without necessarily criticizing data pipelines.>>

Traditional data pipelines take input data from one or more systems, process the data, and write the output data to one or more systems.

Each one of these system has its credentials to access.

Credentials to diverse system has to be provisioned to every user that needs to access the output data.

This creates an proliferation of credentials to different systems. Issuing credentials to different system and keeping the inventory of who has each credential and revocation rights is a logistical challenge.
