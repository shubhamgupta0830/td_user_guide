Overview
==============================================================

Tabsdata is data integration platform that enables pub-sub for tables.

Tabsdata allows data producers to publish their datasets, and data
consumers to discover these datasets and externalize them to their systems
as necessary. Consumers can also combine multiple source datasets or
perform complex manipulations to create intermediate or final datasets
they need from the system.

Tabsdata automates dependencies between datasets and ensures that every
refresh of the source datasets causes the dependent datasets to refresh.
All datasets in Tabsdata are immutable and maintain revision history to
ensure full traceability and provenance for every tuple that exists in
the system.
