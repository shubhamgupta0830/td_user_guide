dataset.RST
-------------

Under dataset:

"and a configuration identifying the inputs of the dataset." 
Is this correct? Initially it was inputs and outputs.


Under dataset function:

"produces as output a set of tables (that will be part of a single dataset)."
Is this correct? Should be. But double checking.

There are two intuitive optimizations that are exposed and built into the dataset function API for developers to use and also makes things simpler for them in a variety of use cases.

Untouched tables: A dataset defines a fixed list of tables and those tables will be available throughout dataset commits. If a dataset execution does not write to one of its output tables, the contents of the table from the previous dataset commit remain.

Table partition CRUD: If a table defines a partition key, the table can be modified at table partition level, fully replacing the table partition. Data from untouched partition tables remains unchanged.


Alternative defintion for trigger:

When defining a dataset it has to be specified what is going to make the dataset function to execute, to produce a new version of data for the dataset. This is referred to as the trigger of the dataset function or dataset.

(IMPORTANT) Dataset execution:

What does this mean?
"If it is a dependency trigger, then execution can be scheduled when the non dependency trigger dataset has a version based on the dataset A version of the dependency trigger dataset.""

Is this correct?
"- When dataset D is triggered, as it depends on datasets B (which is not dependent on anything) and C (which has singular dependency on A), it can be scheduled for execution."
